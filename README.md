## About me
A few words about me, professional experience

My name is Paulina. A few months ago I decided to retrain and start working as a manual tester.
I always felt more technical person and in the past I interested in web development. I worked as a Project Manager in a marketing agency for several years.
I coordinated the creation of websites and my job was a bit related to testing (**one of my main responsibilities was testing features and verifying site functionality and responsiveness**)

I have devoted the last six months to intensive study and acquired theoretical knowledge about testing.
The source of my knowledge was the publications of **experienced mentors/testers, professional courses and the ISTQB syllabus**

**From November 2022 to February 2023 I did an internship as a manual tester** in a software testing company where I had the opportunity to participate in many projects (web and desktop applications), thanks to which I gained my first experience in performing manual tests.

`The internship confirmed my belief that the job of a tester is right for me.` I like to test, because every day you learn something new, every day you can develop. I really like to investigate new features, to look for defects, to discuss different issues with the team.
