##About me##
A few words about me, professional experience

My name is Paulina. A few months ago I decided to retrain and start working as a manual tester.
I always felt more technical person and in the past I interested in web development. I worked as a Project Manager in a marketing agency for several years.
I coordinated the creation of websites and my job was a bit related to testing (**one of my main responsibilities was testing features and verifying site functionality and responsiveness**)
